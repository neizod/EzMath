= Installation Guide for Drupal Module =

Before installing Ezmath module, make sure you already install MathJax module.

== Installation and Setup ==
  # Go to your MathJax module folder. Open `mathjax.js` with text editor.
  # Search for the line that start with `'inlineMath:` and remove it.
  # Replace that line with `'inlineMath: [["\\\\(","\\\\)"]],' +`. This will allow you to save single Dollar sign ($) for text, not for MathJax.
  # Download and uncompress `ezmath.tar.gz` in side your modules folder, which default place is `/sites/all/modules`.
  # Enable `Ezmath filter` module under Administer >> Site building >> Modules.
  # Administer >> Site configuration >>
