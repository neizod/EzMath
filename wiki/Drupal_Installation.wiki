This page will show you how to install and enable Ezmath on Drupal 6.

==System Requirement==
 # Unix/Linux base sever
 # Web server with PHP 5 or above
 # Drupal 6

==Prerequisite Drupal Modules==
 # Filter (core)
 # Libraries API
 # MathJax


==Prerequisite Modules Installation==

===Libraries API===
 # Download "Libraries API" from http://drupal.org/project/libraries
 # Uncompress archive and rename it to "libraries" under "modules" directory.

===MathJax Module===
 # Download "MathJax Module" from http://drupal.org/project/mathjax
 # Uncompress archive and rename it to "mathjax" under "modules" directory.

===MathJax Software===
 # Download "MathJax Software" from http://www.mathjax.org/download/
 # Create your "libraries" directory (e.g. /sites/all/libraries)
 # Uncompress archive and rename it to "mathjax" under "libraries" directory.

After finished this 3 installation, enable "Libraries" and "Mathjax" modules.
   Enable modules at Administer >> Site building >> Modules.


==Ezmath Installation==

 # Go to your MathJax module folder. Open "mathjax.js" with text editor.
 # Search for line that contain "inlineMath" (line 18), replace all line with:
                   'inlineMath: ["\\\\(","\\\\)"]],' +
   This will allow your members write Dollar sign $ without turn it into math.

 # Download and uncompress "ezmath1.x.tar.gz" in side your modules folder,
   which default place is "/sites/all/modules".
 # Enable "Ezmath filter" module at "Administer >> Site building >> Modules".
   (also check MathJax module to be enable!)
 # Add "Ezmath" input at "Administer >> Site configuration >> Input formats".
 # Go to "Rearrange" tab and weight Ezmath to 0, or first execute filter.
 # Test by post new content by place Ezmath syntax between $$ ... $$,
   e.g. $$ a[i][j] * Xi^"T" = [i,j;4,2;x,0] $$.
